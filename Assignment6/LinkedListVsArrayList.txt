Write two differences between ArrayList and LinkedList. 

1. ArrayList is better for storing and accessing data whereas LinkedList is better for manipulaing data. 

2. Insertion and removal of data is easy and fast in LinkedList as compared to ArrayList because of no risk of resizing array.

3. In ArrayList, time complexity is O(1) to get an element from the ArrayList whereas in LinkedList average time complexity is O(n/4), worst case time complexity is O(n).

4. ArrayList class can act as a list only because it implements List only whereas LinkedList class can act as a list and queue both because it implements List and Deque interfaces.
