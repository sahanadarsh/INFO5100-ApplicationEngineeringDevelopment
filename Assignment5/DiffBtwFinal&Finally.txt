Explain the difference between final and finally in Java 8.

final :

1. final is used to apply restrictions on class, method and variable.
2. Making the class final means that it won't be extended by another classes
3. Making the method final means that it won't be overridden in the child classes
4. Making the variable,instant fields or parameter final means that it won't be changed after they are initialized

for example : 
-------------------------------------------
public class Student{

    String name;
    final int age = 20; 

    public Student(){
     
       name = John;
       age = 30;  // not OK because age variable is final, gives compilation error
    }
}

----------------------------------------------

public final Apple extends Fruit{
    //......
}

public class AppleJuice extends Apple{
    // NOT OK --> gives compilation error
}

----------------------------------------------


finally :

1. finally block is an optional block used in exception handling with try/catch block
2. finally block is used to do opearation irresective of the exception thrown or not 


for example :

public class Number {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int firstNumber = 10;
		int secondNumber = 0;
		System.out.println("quotient is " + count(firstNumber,secondNumber ));
	}

	public static int count(int firstNumber, int secondNumber) {
		int result = 0;
		try {
			result = firstNumber % secondNumber;
		} catch(ArithmeticException exe){
			System.out.println("error: " + exe.getMessage());
		} finally {
			System.out.println("executing final block");
		}
		return result;
	}
}
